### A Note on Configuration Values

You may notice that options expecting complex data (branchMapping, secretManagerConfig, etc.) are passed as a single-quoted string. This is a deliberate design choice to work around the constraints of the devcontainer.json format and improve readability.

#### 1. What is a "single-quoted string"?

It means you should structure your configuration like a Python dictionary, using single quotes (') for all keys and string values, instead of the standard double quotes (") used in JSON.

**Example:** `{'host':'app.infisical.com', 'retries':3}`

This avoids the need for cumbersome escaping within your devcontainer.json file.

#### 2. Why is this necessary?

The devcontainer.json specification for features currently only supports primitive types for options, primarily strings and booleans. There isn't a native way to define a nested JSON object directly.

This limitation presents a challenge for advanced features like this one that require structured configuration. To overcome this, we've adopted a pragmatic approach: we pass the structured data as a single, easy-to-read string and parse it inside the feature's installation script. It's an outside-the-box solution for a more complex need.

#### 3. A Known Limitation

This simplified parsing approach has one main trade-off: it does not support single quotes (') within the configuration values themselves (e.g., in a password or token).

If a value in your secret manager configuration contains a single quote, the current parsing logic will fail. While we plan to address this in the future, for now, please ensure your configuration values are free of single quotes.

## üéØ Overview

Managing secrets and environment variables across different branches (development, staging, production) is tedious and error-prone. Manually switching .env files or exporting variables is a common source of mistakes. The Auto Secrets Manager eliminates this problem by:

- **üîÑ Automatic Detection**: Detects git branch changes and maps them to environments
- **üèéÔ∏è Fast Performance**: Uses atomic file operations and intelligent caching (~2-5ms overhead)
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security First**: No hardcoded defaults, atomic operations prevent race conditions
- **üêö Shell Integration**: Works seamlessly with bash and zsh
- **üîß Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box once configured
- **üì¶ Plugin Architecture**: Extensible secret manager support
